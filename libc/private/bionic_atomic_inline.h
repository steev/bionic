/*
 * Inline declarations and macros for some special-purpose atomic
 * operations.  These are intended for rare circumstances where a
 * memory barrier needs to be issued inline rather than as a function
 * call.
 *
 * Most code should not use these.
 *
 * Anything that does include this file must set ANDROID_SMP to either
 * 0 or 1, indicating compilation for UP or SMP, respectively.
 *
 * Macros defined in this header:
 *
 * void ANDROID_MEMBAR_FULL(void)
 *   Full memory barrier.  Provides a compiler reordering barrier, and
 *   on SMP systems emits an appropriate instruction.
